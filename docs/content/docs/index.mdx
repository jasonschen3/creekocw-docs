<h2> About Us </h2>
Creek OpenCourseWare (OCW) is dedicated to providing free, high-quality resources
to students at Cherry Creek High School. Our platform offers a wide range of courses,
notes, and tools to help students achieve their academic goals.

As students who are always invested in helping others learn—often from resources we created ourselves—CreekOCW is our way of facilitating a larger proliferation of the best of these resources. In general and at Creek, sharing knowledge heightens the character of our academics, accelerates the pace of our learning, and deepens the level of our understanding.

<h2> Our Mission </h2>
We believe that by enhancing student learning, OCW will help reduce the temptation
to cheat, plagiarize, and cut corners. Our goal is to provide students with the resources
they need to succeed academically and to alleviate academic stress.

<h2> Future Goals </h2>
We aim to get course material for every class at CCHS and by having collaborations
with the school and teachers. We hope to gain enough traction to bring in students
to help tutor specific classes.

<h2> Contribute </h2>
We would love to have other people contribute or join our team.

<h2> FAQ </h2>
If you have any questions or would like to learn more about our platform, please
feel free to contact us.
